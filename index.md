## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="/img/profile.jpg">

Currently I am a PhD student of Computer Science at Illinois Institute of Technology. I am fortunate to be supervised via Prof. [Yuan Hong](http://cs.iit.edu/~yhong/).

I got my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering and second major in Information Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, affiliated with IEEE Honor Class. My supervisor is Prof. [Xinbing Wang](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~wang-xb/).

I previously worked as research assistant of Deparment of Computing at HK PolyU. My advisor is Prof. [Lei Yang](http://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyanglei/#/pages/profile/about). 

## Research Interest

My reserach foucses on Secure Multiparty Computation, Differential Privacy, Anonymity, while I am also broadly interested in IoT, smart grid, cloud computing, etc..
