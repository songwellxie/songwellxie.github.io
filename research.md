## Current Research 

### SMC in the Smart Grid

To be continue...
### Data Prirvacy

## Previous Research Before PhD
I maily take responsibility for the NFC system design and develplement, while I am also intersted in other areas of research, includes docker, smart grid. 

### ZXing Code

Decode Architecture Analysis [PPT](Zxing-code.pdf) 

Note that all guides were made assume the readers have the fundamental linux system background, and know the [CloudLab](https://cloudlab.us/).

### Docker
* YARN with docker container test
Here I test the different version of hadoop-docker images, and solve the possible error. See [Hadoop-Docker](Hadoop-Docker.pdf).

* Catch the docker container logs 
There are many containers to start at the same time while running hadoop applications. So I write a report use netcat to show how to measure the life cycle of hadoop contaniers and get the logs. [Container](Container-log.pdf).

### Kubenetes 
* Kubenetes Cluster
I set up the kubenetes cluster on Cloudlab, note that kubernets is still under active development. [Kube-cluster](kube-cluster.pdf).

### Cloudlab
* Cloud set
I give specific details about how initilize the machine image for starters on Cloudlab, and use the installation of docker hadoop as example. [Cloudlab-install](Cloudlab-install.pdf).

## Undergraduate
I have acquired a strong EE background both in Power and Information Engineering. And CS courses are also complement to the fields of EE. 


<!--Primarily, I do focus on the Smart Grid-----with the development of traditional power system into smart grid, the revolution also arouse many serious problem for a relatively open and volatile system, particularly for the integration of renewable resources, for example, the security issue caused by some malicious attack, the privacy of usersâ€™ data , etc. Moreover, the convenience and fastness of real-time information exchange may cause a series of challenge to the current plan and operation of power system, and further concern with power investment and economics. -->

### Information & Computer Science
* Academic Paper System Database AceMap

Homepage is [here](http://acemap.sjtu.edu.cn/)
Supervised via Prof. Xinbing Wang, I took up for the academic database, and set up the dataware house for the academic paper system, then finished my thesis.

* Crowd-Sourcing
Taking the professional course Wireless Communications: Principles and Applications, guided by Prof. Xinbing Wang &Prof. Xiaohua Tian. I have been occupied in the study of crowd-sourcing on wireless mobile application guided by Prof.Tian. The reason I choose the topic is the willing to touch more maths and fundamental theory, which also help me in data analysis to some content. What I do now is estimating the current incentive mechanism in crowd-sourcing and try to figure a novel way to perform high-quality & cost-efficiency both.

### Electrical Power System & Electronics
* Power Operation & Market

<!--Under the direction of Prof. [ChuanWen Jiang](http://eei.sjtu.edu.cn/en/Show.aspx?info_id=424&info_lb=326&flag=282), I currently occupied with short-term load forecasting by using Data Mining, based on the development state of one town. I try to dig a mechanism between economic component and load consuming of one town when making generation plan. And the idea struck me when I participated in the research project,"Modeling and Application of Transition of Dual Economics in Henan State Grid", supported by National State Grid of Henan Province.-->

* Three-Phase Grid-Connected Inverter of PV

<!--Led by Prof. Yong Wang, I am working on a new topology based on traditional three-level neutral-point clamped inverter theory and confirm it in practice, as a sub-project of the project "A study of Self-adaptive Digital drive of Multi-MW Wind Power Converters"supervised by Prof.Wang of NSF China. The new topology expects to improve the working efficiency and eliminate the dead interval.-->

### Inter-filed

* Data Security of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI)

<!--I decided to focus on the AMI as my course project of computer network, in communication level. And my biggest point is that I dig it from the fundamental thing----Smart Meter. I analyzed and set up a model for smart meter, then try to find corresponding mechanisms for its security issues. And I want to get some idea of communication protocol concerns with security and privacy of metering data on smart meter's communication. -->

* Crowdsourcing & Data Center

<!--I studied the basic mathematic theory about the crowd-sourcing at the game theory point, and it came out to me that I may just take the advantage of large number of metering information in power system to do some things. And for data center, how to collocation with these energy-consuming monsters to reduce the cost is currently my interest. -->
